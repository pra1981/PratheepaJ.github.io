<h2>Integrating multi-domian genome-level data</h2>
<p>High-throughput sequencing and mass cytometry technologies have revolutionized the quantification of molecular and biological multiple mediators at the geome-level. The data produced by these techniques are complex in nature because of high-dimensionality, heterogeneity, multi-domain, and sparse.</p>
<p>My current research focus on establishing a data structure and probabilistic modeling for multi-domain data.</p>
