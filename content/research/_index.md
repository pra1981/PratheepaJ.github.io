My research interests include topics in 

1) multi-domain and spatio-temporal statistical methods to various problems in high-throughput sequencing (HiSeq) and single-cell sequencing data, and 

2) saddlepoint approximations to problems in high-dimensional statistical inference. 

My current research focuses on developing probabilistic models for leveraging both microbiome and mass cytometry data. 

My recent research has focused on the block bootstrap method for longitudinal microbiome data and Bayesian reference analysis for removing contamination in microbial studies. 

My Ph.D. dissertation was on developing statistical methods based on saddlepoint approximations to make inferences on time series and survival data.

My master thesis focused on developing a computationally fast and accurate method to make inferences on spatial regression model parameters based on saddlepoint approximations.
