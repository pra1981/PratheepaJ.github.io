My research interests include topics in 1) statistical modeling of multidomain and longitudinal data to various problems in high-throughput sequencing (HiSeq) and mass cytometry (CyTOF) and 2) saddlepoint approximations to problems in statistical inference. 

My current research focuses on developing statistical methods to leverage both microbiome and mass cytometry data. My recent research has focused on block bootstrap method for longitudinal microbiome data and Bayesian inference for identifying DNA contaminants. 

My PhD dissertation was on developing statistical methods based on saddlepoint approximations to make inferences on spatial, time series, and survival data.

My master thesis focused on developing a computationally fast and accurate method to make inferences on spatial regression model parameters based on saddlepoint approximations.
