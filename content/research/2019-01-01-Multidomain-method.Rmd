##  Integrating multi-domian genome-level data

High-throughput sequencing and mass cytometry technologies have revolutionized the quantification of molecular and biological multiple mediators at the geome-level. The data produced by these techniques are complex in nature because of high-dimensionality, heterogeneity, multi-domain, and sparse.

My current research focus on establishing a data structure and probabilistic modeling for multi-domain data.
