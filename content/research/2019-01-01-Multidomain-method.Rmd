High-throughput technologies (Next-generation DNA sequencing, single-cell RNA sequencing, Mass spectrometry, etc.) have revolutionized the quantification of biomarkers at the genome-level. The high-throughput genomic data are complex in nature because of high-dimensionality, heterogeneity, multi-domain, and sparsity.

##  Data structure for multi-domain genome-level data

First, I am working on establishing a data structure for multi-domain genome-level data in R/Bioconductor. 

##  Statistical method for multi-domain genome-level data

Second, I focus on developing probabilistic modeling for multi-domain genome-level data in R/Bioconductor/Stan.
