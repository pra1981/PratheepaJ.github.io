##  Integrating Microbiome and CyTOF data

High-throughput and mass cytometry technologies have revolutionized the quantification of human diseases with molecular and biological multiple mediators. The data produced by these techniques are complex in nature because of high-dimensionality, heterogeneity, multi-domain, and dependency.
I am currently working on establishing a data structure and workflow for storing, processing, transforming, visualizing multi-domain data.
