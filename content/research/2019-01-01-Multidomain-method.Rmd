High-throughput sequencing and mass cytometry technologies have revolutionized the quantification of molecular and biological multiple mediators at the geome-level. The data produced by these techniques are complex in nature because of high-dimensionality, heterogeneity, multi-domain, and sparse.

##  Data structure for multi-domian genome-level data

First, I am working on establishing a data structure for multi-domian genome-level data in R/Bioconductor. 

##  Statistical method for multi-domian genome-level data

Second, I focus on developing probabilistic modeling for multi-domain genome-level data in R/Bioconductor/Stan.
