If you expect to have trust on significant other, be fully transparent: especially those things that you donâ€™t want to share. Let other significant decide the full dimension of love.

```{r first-ext-image, fig.cap="March 20, 2016", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('/img/March_20_2016.jpg')
```

\@ref(fig:first-ext-image) is my attempt to embed an external image in a Rmarkdown file.
