## Background

I am a postdoctoral research fellow in the Department of Statistics at Stanford University, working with [Susan Holmes](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~susan/). My research interests include topics in 1) statistical modeling of multi-domain and longitudinal data to various problems in high-throughput sequencing (HiSeq) and mass cytometry (CyTOF) and 2) saddlepoint approximations to problems in statistical inference. 

My current research focuses on developing statistical methods to leverage both microbiome and mass cytometry data. My recent research has focused on block bootstrap method for longitudinal microbiome data and Bayesian inference for identifying DNA contaminants. 

I received a Ph.D. in Mathematics (2016) with an emphasis in Statistics from Texas Tech University, advised by [Alex Trindade](http://www.math.ttu.edu/~atrindad/). My dissertation was on developing statistical methods based on saddlepoint approximations to make inferences on spatial, time series, and survival data. While I was a doctoral student, I experienced in applying the statistical methods for metagenomic and clinical research at (1) the [Research & Testing Laboratory](http://www.medicalbiofilm.org/) in Lubbock, advised by [Stephen Boyd Cox](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stephen_Cox3)
and (2) the [Clinical Research Institute](https://www.ttuhsc.edu/clinical-research/) at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, advised by [Alex Trindade](http://www.math.ttu.edu/~atrindad/).

I received an MS in Statistics from Texas Tech University, advised by [Alex Trindade](http://www.math.ttu.edu/~atrindad/). My master thesis focused on developing a computationally fast and accurate method to make inferences on spatial regression model parameters based on saddlepoint approximations. I received a BS degree in Statistics and Operations Research from [University of Peradeniya](https://sci.pdn.ac.lk/scs/) in Sri Lanka and was a lecturer in statistics before coming to Texas Tech University.

Apart from research, I am interested in teaching, mentoring, curriculum development, and community outreach. Specifically, I am interested in teaching the theoretical understanding of statistical methods.
