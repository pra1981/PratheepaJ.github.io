## Biography

I am a postdoctoral research fellow in the Department of Statistics at Stanford University. I am advised by [Susan Holmes](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~susan/). I am broadly interested in statistical modeling of multi-domain and longitudinal data with applications to high-throughput sequencing (HiSeq) and mass cytometry (CyTOF). My current research is developing statistical methods to leverage both microbiome and mass cytometry data.  

I received a Ph.D. in Mathematics (2016) with an emphasis in Statistics from Texas Tech University under the supervision of [Alex Trindade](http://www.math.ttu.edu/~atrindad/). My doctoral dissertation was developing statistical methods based on saddlepoint approximations to make inferences on spatial, time series, and survival data. While I was a doctoral student, I gained experience in applying the statistical methods for metagenomic and clinical research at the [Research & Testing Laboratory](http://www.medicalbiofilm.org/) in Lubbock advised by ([Stephen Boyd Cox](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stephen_Cox3)
) and the [Clinical Research Institute](https://www.ttuhsc.edu/clinical-research/) at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center advised by [Alex Trindade](http://www.math.ttu.edu/~atrindad/).

I received a MS in Statistics from Texas Tech University under the supervision of [Alex Trindade](http://www.math.ttu.edu/~atrindad/). My master thesis was developing a computationally fast and accurate method to make inferences on spatial regression model parameters based on saddlepoint approximations. I received a BS degree in Statistics and Operations Research from [University of Peradeniya](https://sci.pdn.ac.lk/scs/) in Sri Lanka and was a lecturer in statistics before coming to Texas Tech University.

I am also interested in teaching, mentoring, curriculum development, and community outreach. Specifically, I am interested in teaching the theoretical understanding of statistical methods.
