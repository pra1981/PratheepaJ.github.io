## Background

I am a postdoctoral research fellow in the Department of Statistics at Stanford University, working with [Susan Holmes](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~susan/). 

I received a Ph.D. in Mathematics (2016) with an emphasis in Statistics from Texas Tech University, advised by [Alex Trindade](http://www.math.ttu.edu/~atrindad/). As an intern, I used statistical methods for analyzing metagenomic and clinical data at (1) the [Research & Testing Laboratory](http://www.medicalbiofilm.org/) in Lubbock, advised by [Stephen Boyd Cox](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stephen_Cox3)
and (2) the [Clinical Research Institute](https://www.ttuhsc.edu/clinical-research/) at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, advised by [Alex Trindade](http://www.math.ttu.edu/~atrindad/).

I received an MS in Statistics from Texas Tech University, advised by [Alex Trindade](http://www.math.ttu.edu/~atrindad/). I received a BS degree in Statistics and Operations Research from [University of Peradeniya](https://sci.pdn.ac.lk/scs/) in Sri Lanka and was a lecturer in statistics before coming to Texas Tech University.

Apart from research, I am interested in teaching, mentoring, curriculum development, community outreach, sports, and art.
