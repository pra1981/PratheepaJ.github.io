Such experiments consist of repeated biological observations from each subject over time and are essential in accounting for the high between-subject and within-subject variability.\nLongitudinal microbiome data are used to either model abundance over time or compare the abundances of bacteria between two or more cohorts. We have devised a method for making nonparametric inferences in longitudinal microbiome data in the latter case.\nMethod The proposed resampling method combined moving block bootstrap (MBB) method (Lahiri 2013), empirical subsampling method (Hall, Horowitz, and Jing 1995), mixture model (McMurdie and Holmes 2014), generalized linear model (Diggle 2002), generalized estimating equation (Liang and Zeger 1986), median-ratio method (Anders and Huber 2010), and shrinkage estimation(Robbins 1956; Stephens 2016) to enabling inference on microbiome longitudinal data. With the optimal block size computed using subsampling, the MBB method accounts for within-subject dependency by using overlapping blocks of repeated observations within each subject to draw valid inferences based on approximately pivotal statistics. This resampling method for dependent data was motivated by the literature on the block bootstrap method for time series data along with subsampling method for optimal block size estimation.\n Software I developed an open-source R package bootLong to make our method accessible and provide tools for exploring within-subject dependency in longitudinal data. Look at the tutorial.\n Paper The manuscript is available at arXiv.\n  Bayesian Inference for Removing DNA Contaminants in Low-Biomass Samples With the potential to diagnose any known microbial organism, metagenomic Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) has been regarded as a tool that will revolutionize infectious disease diagnostics. NGS removes the need for a pre-informed hypothesis from clinicians, detects nonculturable organisms, and can be optimized to include a turnaround time of 24-48 hours. Only recently, however, has the scientific community begun to understand the pitfalls of NGS. Microbial nucleic acids from reagent and lab environment contamination have been shown to result in signals that researchers falsely infer to be the cause of a patient’s illness. This problem is exacerbated in low biomass samples, such as plasma, where more than 99% of sequencing reads align to the human genome .\nAlthough extracting and sequencing molecular-grade water to provide negative controls helps overcome this issue, downstream analysis can still be challenging because many common contaminants are also clinically relevant organisms. Computational methods to identify contaminants in ultra-low biomass samples are limited.\nSoftware Our method will be available as an open-source R package at BARBI.

Method Software Paper  Saddlepoint-Based Bootstrap Method (SPBB) Method Software Paper    Multivariate Saddlepoint-Based Bootstrap Method (mSPBB) The second project for my PhD dissertation was to generalize the SPBB method to make inferences on the multiple parameters of a statistical model. Although there are other methods such as asymptotic and bootstrap methods to solve inference problems, the SPBB method is more computationally efficient and accurate. For example, the SPBB method replaces the multiple simulation runs required by the bootstrap method with a single approximation to the joint cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the estimators.\nMethod  Software  Paper I presented my work on mSPBB in my PhD dissertation part I.\nThese are unpublished work.\n  Saddlepoint Approximation for Bivariate Cumultative Distribution Function (CDF) We defined the formula for the variable that was not defined in Wang (1990)\nCorrection to the formula  Software  Paper   Empirical Saddlepoint Approximations for Smoothing Survival Functions Under Right Censoring. One of the projects for my dissertation work was to derive a class of statistical method to estimate a smooth survival curve sought to extend the empirical saddlepoint method based on the Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimator. The KM estimator is a commonly used nonparametric estimator of a survival function, but KM estimator only defines the approximate probability of observed failure times and may not define a proper density function if the largest observation is right censored.\nMethod To work around these issues, we define the empirical moment generating function (MGF) of the tail-completed density function based on the KM estimator, then, using the saddlepoint method, accurately approximate a smooth survival function. Before using the saddlepoint method for this purpose, however, we establish the convergence results of the modified version of the empirical MGF based on the KM estimator using the M-estimation and multivariate delta method. According to the simulations, the empirical saddlepoint approximation method produces better estimation than existing methods, such as log-spline. We apply this method for several event-time data from the clinical research to estimate a smooth survival curve.\n Software I developed an open-source R package ESPA that make our method easily accessible. Look at the tutorial.\n Paper Paper will be available at the Canadian journal of statistics (accepted - 2018).\n  Saddlepoint-Based Bootstrap Method (SPBB) We consider a class of statistical method called saddlepoint-based bootstrap (SPBB) method to make inference about the spatial dependence parameter in the spatial regression model. In the spatial econometrics, the analyst can use the SPBB method to analyze the significance of the spatial dependence parameter. Then, the analyst could also decide whether to use the spatial autoregressive model, the conditional autoregressive model, or the spatial moving average model to fit the spatial lattice data.\nMethod The SPBB method is used to construct confidence intervals for parameter whose estimator is a unique root of a quadratic estimating equation. In the SPBB method, we use the monotonicity of the quadratic estimating equation in parameter to relate the distribution of an estimator to the distribution of the respective quadratic estimating equation. Using the saddlepoint methods, it is then possible to accurately approximate the distribution of the estimator. Then confidence interval can be produced by pivoting the distribution of the estimator.\n Software An R pacakge SPBBspatial implements our method.

R Markdown/Latex is highly recommended to write the midterm project proposal report and final project report. Install the following software:  R (required): https://www.r-project.org/. R Studio is highly recommended for syntax highlighting, package management, document generation, and more: https://www.rstudio.com/.  The newest version of R Studio is highly recommended (v1.1.463).  Latex, which will enable you to create PDFs directly from the R Markdown in RStudio.  Mac users should download macTeX http://www.tug.org/mactex/downloading.html from Safari (not Chrome). Windows users should install MiKTeX https://miktex.org/download.     Grading The final letter grade for this course will be determined by each method of assessment weighted as follows:\n Class participation (5%) Weekly homework assignments (50%) Midterm project proposal (10%, due on 05/03/2019) Final project (35%, due on 06/05/2019)   Policies  Class Participation  This includes in-class participation and Canvas Discussion. When homework involves simulations and data analysis, you will use R statistical computing software. Please post your R or R Markdown questions to Canvas Discussion. Instructor or TA or other students in your class can answer your questions. When asking questions about code, be specific (copy and paste the exact error, relevant code, and describe what you are attempting to do). We will not answer questions that are too similar to the problem sets or that would be better answered in office hours with a whiteboard. Needless to say, you should conduct yourself in a courteous and respectful manner on Canvas Discussion. The class-participation credit is based on the instructor’s subjective judgment of the effort involved.  Weekly homework assignments  Homework assignment will be assigned every Friday on Canvas Assignments. Homework assignment will be due every Friday.  Turn-in your completed homework assignment in PDF and R Markdown file to TA:  Use R markdown in R Studio and render it to PDF  See the following link for further outline of using R markdown for reporting.  Each question in the homework assignment will be graded as follows: \\(scale \\in \\left\\lbrace0,1,2,3,4\\right\\rbrace\\)  4: submitted on time and more or less completely correct 3: submitted on time and partially correct answer 2: late submission and more or less completely correct 1: late submission and partially correct answer 0: late submission (any day after the due date for more than one homework assignment) or submitted with a completely incorrect answer  Each student can hand in only one homework late (within two days after the deadline). After attempting homework problems on an individual basis, students may discuss a homework assignment with their classmates. However, students must write up their own solutions individually and explicitly indicate from whom (if anyone) or resources students received help at the top of their homework solutions.  Project description:  The term project should allow you to see nonparametric statistical methods applied to your field of interest or a theoretical study if that is your primary interest. The project can be one of the following types or a combination of elements from each. A case study, if you have some original data, and a statistical problem that you want to solve with nonparametric statistics. A comparative study, you would like to compare the performance of the nonparametric statistical methods with other methods in different situations. A literature review on related papers that will be provided and the literature review should involve in-depth summaries and exposition of one of these papers. You have the freedom to select a paper of your own interest, as long as it is related to the topics of this course.   Midterm project content  The project proposal can be 3-5 pages long (excluding bibliography that should be very complete). Please do not propose an overly ambitious project. Some guidelines: A simple and clear exposition of the problem that you are addressing. Describe the data. Review of available methods for such data. List the advantages and disadvantages of those methods, in particular, parametric versus nonparametric methods. A proposed solution to the problem using the nonparametric method. Present a flowchart of the various tasks to complete your project: data collection, programming, simulation, etc.   Final project content  The project report can be 10-12 pages long (excluding bibliography that should be very complete) You should email the R Markdown for the simulation and analysis to the TA: qzhao1 [at] stanford [dot] edu. Some guidelines: Background of the data and why it is interesting or important. Explanation of the method studied and its properties. Data analysis or simulation study. Interpretation of the results or discussion.   Accessible Education  Students with Documented Disabilities: Students who may need an academic accommodation based on the impact of a disability must initiate the request with the Office of Accessible Education (OAE). Professional staff will evaluate the request with required documentation, recommend reasonable accommodations, and prepare an Accommodation Letter for faculty. Unless the student has a temporary disability, Accommodation letters are issued for the entire academic year. Students should contact the OAE as soon as possible since timely notice is needed to coordinate accommodations. The OAE is located at 563 Salvatierra Walk (phone: 723-1066, URL:https://oae.stanford.edu/.) Provide me an accommodation letter on or before 04/03/2019.  Honor Code  Students are bound by the Stanford Honor Code. Violation of the honor code will result in a failing grade among other penalties.
