      <description>Data structure (container) for multi-domain genome-level data Statistical method for multi-domain genome-level data   High-throughput technologies (Next-generation DNA sequencing, single-cell RNA sequencing, Mass spectrometry, etc.) have revolutionized the quantification of biomarkers at the genome-level. The high-throughput genomic data are complex because of high-dimensionality, heterogeneity, multi-domain, and sparsity.
Data structure (container) for multi-domain genome-level data First, I am working on establishing a data structure for multi-domain genome-level data in R/Bioconductor.</description>

      <description>Block Bootstrap Method Method Software Paper My Presentations  A Bayesian Approach to Contamination Removal in Molecular Microbial Studies Software Paper(s) My Presentations  References   Block Bootstrap Method Rapidly evolving high-throughput sequencing technology enables the comprehensive search for microbial biomarkers using longitudinal experiments. Such experiments consist of repeated biological observations from each subject over time and are essential in accounting for the high between-subject and within-subject variability.</description>

      <description>Topic modeling for indentifying variation in microbial communities in plants and soil environment My Presentations  Statistical Challenges in Microbiome Genome-level Data   Topic modeling for indentifying variation in microbial communities in plants and soil environment Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)-based technology now enables the high-throughput quantification of non-culturable microbial organisms in all environments. The use of microbial sequences has enhanced our understanding of the microbiome interactions at the interface of host-plant and soil environment and their roles in microbial ecology.</description>
