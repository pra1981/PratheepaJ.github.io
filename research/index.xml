      <description>Integrating Microbiome and CyTOF data Modeling the Dynamical Interactions   Integrating Microbiome and CyTOF data High-throughput and mass cytometry technologies have revolutionized the quantification of human diseases with molecular and biological multiple mediators. The data produced by these techniques are complex in nature because of high-dimensionality, heterogeneity, multi-domain, and dependency. I am currently working on establishing a data structure and workflow for storing, processing, transforming, visualizing multi-domain data.</description>

      <description>Block Bootstrap Method Method Software Paper  Bayesian Inference for Removing DNA Contaminants in Low-Biomass Samples Software Paper(s)  References   Block Bootstrap Method Rapidly evolving high-throughput sequencing technology enables the comprehensive search for microbial biomarkers using longitudinal experiments. Such experiments consist of repeated biological observations from each subject over time and are essential in accounting for the high between-subject and within-subject variability.
Longitudinal microbiome data are used to either model abundance over time or compare the abundances of bacteria between two or more cohorts.</description>
