      <description>Data structure for multi-domain genome-level data Statistical method for multi-domain genome-level data   High-throughput sequencing and mass cytometry technologies have revolutionized the quantification of molecular and biological multiple mediators at the genome-level. The data produced by these techniques are complex in nature because of high-dimensionality, heterogeneity, multi-domain, and sparsity.
Data structure for multi-domain genome-level data First, I am working on establishing a data structure for multi-domain genome-level data in R/Bioconductor.</description>

Such experiments consist of repeated biological observations from each subject over time and are essential in accounting for the high between-subject and within-subject variability.</description>
