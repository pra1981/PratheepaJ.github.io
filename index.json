Such experiments consist of repeated biological observations from each subject over time and are essential in accounting for the high between-subject and within-subject variability.\nLongitudinal microbiome data are used to either model abundance over time or compare the abundances of bacteria between two or more cohorts. We have devised a method for making nonparametric inferences in longitudinal microbiome data in the latter case.\nMethod The proposed resampling method combined moving block bootstrap (MBB) method (Lahiri 2013), empirical subsampling method (Hall, Horowitz, and Jing 1995), mixture model (McMurdie and Holmes 2014), generalized linear model (Diggle 2002), generalized estimating equation (Liang and Zeger 1986), median-ratio method (Anders and Huber 2010), and shrinkage estimation(Robbins 1956; Stephens 2016) to enabling inference on microbiome longitudinal data. With the optimal block size computed using subsampling, the MBB method accounts for within-subject dependency by using overlapping blocks of repeated observations within each subject to draw valid inferences based on approximately pivotal statistics. This resampling method for dependent data was motivated by the literature on the block bootstrap method for time series data along with subsampling method for optimal block size estimation.\n Software I developed an open-source R package bootLong to make our method accessible and provide tools for exploring within-subject dependency in longitudinal data.

A Bayesian Approach to Contamination Removal in Molecular Microbial Studies With the potential to diagnose any known microbial organism, metagenomic Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) has been regarded as a tool that will revolutionize infectious disease diagnostics. NGS removes the need for a pre-informed hypothesis from clinicians, detects nonculturable organisms, and can be optimized to include a turnaround time of 24-48 hours. Only recently, however, has the scientific community begun to understand the pitfalls of NGS. Microbial nucleic acids from reagent and lab environment contamination have been shown to result in signals that researchers falsely infer to be the cause of a patient’s illness. This problem is exacerbated in low biomass samples, such as plasma, where more than 99% of sequencing reads align to the human genome .\nAlthough extracting and sequencing molecular-grade water to provide negative controls helps overcome this issue, downstream analysis can still be challenging because many common contaminants are also clinically relevant organisms. Computational methods to identify contaminants in low biomass samples are limited.\nSoftware Our method will be available as an open-source R package at BARBI.

Method Software Paper  Saddlepoint-Based Bootstrap Method (SPBB) Method Software Paper    Multivariate Saddlepoint-Based Bootstrap Method (mSPBB) In my first project for my PhD dissertation, I generalized the SPBB method to make inferences on the multiple parameters of a statistical model. Although there are other methods such as asymptotic and bootstrap methods to solve inference problems, the SPBB method is more computationally efficient and accurate. For example, the SPBB method replaces the multiple simulation runs required by the bootstrap method with a single approximation to the joint cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the estimators.\nI derived the necessary and sufficient conditions to approximate the CDF of estimators via estimating equations.\nMethod  Software  Paper  PhD dissertation Chapter I, section 1.2.

These are unpublished work.\n  Empirical Saddlepoint Approximations for Smoothing Survival Functions Under Right Censoring. The second project for my dissertation focused on deriving a class of statistical method to estimate a smooth survival curve sought to extend the empirical saddlepoint method based on the Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimator. The KM estimator is a commonly used nonparametric estimator of a survival function, but KM estimator only defines the approximate probability of observed failure times and may not define a proper density function if the largest observation is right censored.\nMethod To work around these issues, we define the empirical moment generating function (MGF) of the tail-completed density function based on the KM estimator, then, using the saddlepoint method, accurately approximate a smooth survival function. Before using the saddlepoint method for this purpose, however, we establish the convergence results of the modified version of the empirical MGF based on the KM estimator using the M-estimation and multivariate delta method. According to the simulations, the empirical saddlepoint approximation method produces better estimation than existing methods, such as log-spline. We apply this method for several event-time data from the clinical research to estimate a smooth survival curve.\n Software I developed an open-source R package ESPA that make our method easily accessible.

In the spatial econometrics, the analyst can use the SPBB method to analyze the significance of the spatial dependence parameter. Then, the analyst could also decide whether to use the spatial autoregressive model, the conditional autoregressive model, or the spatial moving average model to fit the spatial lattice data.\nMethod The SPBB method is used to construct confidence intervals for parameter whose estimator is a unique root of a quadratic estimating equation. In the SPBB method, we use the monotonicity of the quadratic estimating equation in parameter to relate the distribution of an estimator to the distribution of the respective quadratic estimating equation. Using the saddlepoint methods, it is then possible to accurately approximate the distribution of the estimator. Then confidence interval can be produced by pivoting the distribution of the estimator.\n Software An R package SPBBspatial implements our method.
